Agua: Clean Water and Sanitation

Clean water and sanitation means having access to safe and hygienic drinking water, as well as proper sanitation facilities and services, 
which are essential for maintaining good health and improving overall quality of life. With that in mind, this project seeks to create a website 
that advocates for clean water to drink and proper sanitation, as well as a platform for spreading knowledge about it and rallying support for it.
